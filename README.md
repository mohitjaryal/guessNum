# 🎯 Guess The Number Game (Python)

## 💡 Overview
**Guess The Number** is a fun and beginner-friendly Python project where the computer randomly selects a number, and the player tries to guess it in as few attempts as possible.  

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of loops, conditional statements, user input handling, and random number generation using core Python concepts — all while building a simple, interactive game.
